Divide and conquer Algorithm Problems.
1. Implement a problem of number of zeroes.
Statement: Given an array of 1s and 0s which has all 1s first
followed by all 0s? Find the number of 0s. Count the number of
zeroes in the given array.
Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0} Output: 2
Input: arr[] = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0} Output: 4
CO1
2. Implement a problem of move all zeroes to end of array.
Statement: Given an array of random numbers, Push all the zeroâ€™s
of a given array to the end of the array. For example, if the given
arrays is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, it should be changed to {1,
9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}. The order of all other elements should be
same.
Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0};
Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0};

3. Implement a problem of smallest number with at least n
trailing zeroes in factorial.
Statement: Given a number n. The task is to find the smallest
number whose factorial contains at least n trailing zeroes.
Input : n = 1 Output : 5
Input : n = 6 Output : 25
