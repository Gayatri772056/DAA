#Divide and conquer Algorithm Problems.
1. Implement a problem of number of zeroes.
Statement: Given an array of 1s and 0s which has all 1s first
followed by all 0s? Find the number of 0s. Count the number of
zeroes in the given array.
Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0} Output: 2
Input: arr[] = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0} Output: 4
CO1
2. Implement a problem of move all zeroes to end of array.
Statement: Given an array of random numbers, Push all the zeroâ€™s
of a given array to the end of the array. For example, if the given
arrays is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, it should be changed to {1,
9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}. The order of all other elements should be
same.
Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0};
Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0};
CO1
3. Implement a problem of smallest number with at least n
trailing zeroes in factorial.
Statement: Given a number n. The task is to find the smallest
number whose factorial contains at least n trailing zeroes.
Input : n = 1 Output : 5
Input : n = 6 Output : 25

#Greedy Stategy
2. Implement a problem of maximize Profit by trading stocks
based on given rate per day.
Statement: Given an array arr[] of N positive integers which
denotes the cost of selling and buying a stock on each of
the N days. The task is to find the maximum profit that can be
earned by buying a stock on or selling all previously bought stocks
on a particular day.
Input: arr[] = {2, 3, 5} Output: 5
Input: arr[] = {8, 5, 1} Output: 0
3. Implement a problem of minimum work to be done per day to CO2
finish given tasks within D days problem.
Statement: Given an array task[] of size N denoting amount of
work to be done for each task, the problem is to find the minimum
amount of work to be done on each day so that all the tasks can be
completed in at most D days. Note: On one day work can be done
for only one task.
Input: task[] = [3, 4, 7, 15], D = 10 Output: 4
Input: task[] = [30, 20, 22, 4, 21], D = 6 Output: 22
